# PlayerBot
Fabric mod that runs a discord bot that lets discord users add themselves to the minecraft whitelist.

Note that this bot isn't super secure in that it blindly trusts anyone to provide their legitimate minecraft name. Once added, it can only be removed by the same discord user, but there's no mechanism in place that prevents someone from adding someone else. A verification mechanism is planned to be added.
